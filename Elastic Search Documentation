Elastic Search Documentation

Current Implementation

Library 
Django haystack(2.8.1) - https://github.com/django-haystack/django-haystack
elasticsearch - 6.3.0
drf-haystack - 1.8.3
AWS Elastic Search Version - 2.3


- There is a EC2 machine that have 4 crons that run every 5 minutes to update indexes

Current Issues/Limitation

- EC2 running 24/7 just to update index
- Data is not encrypted in ES node
- Elastic Search Version is old (2.3)
- No Monitoring of cron




Enhancemenet V1 - Update Elastic version to 5.6 and enable encryption at rest for indexes

 - Backend branch - elastic_search_version_upgrade
 - PR - https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories/verifi.backend/pull-requests/2076/changes?region=us-east-2
 - Note: Django Haystack doesn't have special support for ES 5.x version. There is a master branch which contains unofficial support for 5.x. We have enhanced a code little to fix some issues that was not working.


Setting up Elastic search 5.6 cluster on AWS

branch - elastic_search_terraform
PR - https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories/verifi.backend/pull-requests/4152/details?region=us-east-2

1) Create ES cluster on AWS using terraform scripts

cd terraform/elastic_search/elastic_search_cluster

terraform apply -var-file=stage.tfvars

2) Create ES roles and s3 bucket that will be required by the API's in next step


cd terraform/elastic_search/elastic_search_snapshot_roles

terraform apply -var-file=stage.tfvars in elastic_search_snapshot_roles


3) Create and Restore the snapshot

python create_snapshot.py


4) Update Route 53 url

5) Update ES EC2 backend code

To check health of ES Cluster

* Not working direct api call for alias 
* Used non-official git hub repo
* there would be one infra (es_upgrade with req.txt) and one backend (code change) + tf scripts 
* How to deploy on ES machine (needs to put all code there too) and one deployment for other clusters
* Why Book: {role_permissions.CAN_ACCESS_BOOK_INVENTORY_TAB: False},
* Changed code of ESEngine Elasticsearch5SearchEngine
* Check diff between ES2.x and ES5.x queries
